# Silent File Reading Failure in R

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in R code involving file reading.  The code utilizes `tryCatch` to handle potential errors during file reading, but it silently ignores errors.  This can lead to unexpected behavior and difficult-to-debug issues when the target file is missing.

The `bug.R` file contains the problematic code. The `bugSolution.R` file shows how to improve error handling for better robustness.

## Problem
The primary issue is that the `tryCatch` block returns `NULL` when an error occurs.  This lacks informative feedback, making it difficult to identify file-related issues.

## Solution
The solution involves providing more informative error messages to the user and using more specific error handling.  The improved code provides explicit error messages, making debugging much easier.
